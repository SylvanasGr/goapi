# Explore Go Projects

This repository is organized to help you explore different Go projects, each residing in a separate branch. The goal is to understand and experiment with best practices and common methods for working with Go APIs. Remember, there's no intention to merge these projects into the master branch at this stage.

## Branches

### [project-1](../../tree/project-1)

Description: Brief description of the first Go project.

#### How to Explore

1. Checkout the branch: `git checkout project-1`
2. Explore the project and its codebase.
3. Experiment, make changes, and document your observations.

### [project-2](../../tree/project-2)

Description: Brief description of the second Go project.

#### How to Explore

1. Checkout the branch: `git checkout project-2`
2. Explore the project and its codebase.
3. Experiment, make changes, and document your observations.

### [project-3](../../tree/project-3)

Description: Brief description of the third Go project.

#### How to Explore

1. Checkout the branch: `git checkout project-3`
2. Explore the project and its codebase.
3. Experiment, make changes, and document your observations.

## Exploration Guidelines

- **Experimentation**: Feel free to modify code, test different approaches, and learn from the process.
- **Documentation**: Keep notes on your observations, best practices, and any challenges faced.
- **Communication**: Share your findings with the community, ask questions, and seek feedback.

## Note

Remember that the master branch is reserved for integrating well-explored and tested code. At this stage, focus on exploration and understanding without the pressure of merging everything together.

Happy exploring!
